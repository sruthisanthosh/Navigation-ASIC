\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\textrm  {\textmd  {Many real time applications where control Systems are utilized benefit from having hardware that can handle real time data. In situations where large-scale production of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for each and every problem situation is not feasible most conventional design requirements are met using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This approach yields the benefit of the same template hardware boards to be reconfigured as per the specific application, even on the fly and give considerable flexibility to the platform while also contributing heavily to the considerable cost of the overall design. Hence for applications like Navigation systems for satellites the benefits of both approaches can be combined to create an ASIC which includes a processing core, multiple configurable logic blocks, support for standard IO interface standards and protocols and ADC/DACs, all on the same silicon. This allows considerable benefits to help tailor custom hardware, specific to the needs where the system is to deployed while allowing for the reliability and cost-effectiveness of Large scale production of ASICs in house.}}}{1}\protected@file@percent }

The ISA is a becoming a vastly popular alternative to CISC architectures and proprietary popular RISC architectures like ARM. The applications the system will encouter warrants the use of RISCV32-IM, which is the integer operation base 32 bit variant of the RISC-V ISA, with the multiply/divide extension.The processing core should preferably be pipelined and have necessary hazard detection and mitigation schemes.}}}{2}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\textrm  {\textmd  {The inclusion of FPGA Blocks on the die presents unique software and hardware challenges that require adapting known standard solutions to function in the unique environment the ASIC design creates.These include adapting bus standards for ease of communication with and programming of the FPGA. Establishing optimal routing for the given FPGA architecture and automating the process of synthesizing a design on the FPGA blocks using the processing core, handling and generation of multiple clock domains internally and ability for the SoC to drive output pins to different output voltage standards according to the application. This also brings about the need for an integrated onboard or external power management solution and multiple IO voltage domains. The project aims to create a unique ASIC that currently does not exist in the market and can find application in multiple domains. }}}{2}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\textrm  {\textmd  { The RISC-V Instruction-set Architecture is highly pipelining friendly as well as being comparatively easier to implement in hardware than nore conventional RISC ISAs like MIPS. This enables the design of a fast, minimalistic, pipelined compute core that can easily work as a backbone for the additional components necessary to meet the application requirements. It follows that a flexible yet simple FPGA architecture needs to be identified keeping in mind both the ease of ease of implementation and ease of programming it by the core. The Navigation ASIC will encounter both Real-Time Data and Complex Decision making tasks. Hence the compute core and the FPGA elements have distict roles to play in the ASIC. The FPGA block can be programmed to have Logic that handles the real time data while the compute core can handle less time-constrained tasks. To take it one step further the FPGA can be programmed on the fly by the compute core, thus ensuring better flexibility for the ASIC as well as making it much more of a powerful solution, eventhouh the individual components are not by any stretch, new architectural elements.}}}{3}\protected@file@percent }

The Logical Inverse of this operation is required for the BNE(Branch if Not Equal) instruction. This can be achieved by inverting the implications of the compare. If the ouput of the ALU is zero then the branch is dropped, else if the output is non-zero thenthe branch is taken.
